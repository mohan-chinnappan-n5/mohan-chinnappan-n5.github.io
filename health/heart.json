        "The human heart is an incredible organ that pumps blood throughout our body. It has four main chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The **right atrium** and **ventricle** pump deoxygenated blood to the lungs, while the **left atrium** and **ventricle** pump oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.",
        "Key parts of the heart include the atria, ventricles, valves (such as the mitral and aortic valves), and blood vessels like the aorta and pulmonary artery. Each part plays a critical role in maintaining effective circulation."

        "The heart works as a pump, pushing blood through a network of arteries, veins, and capillaries. It beats about **100,000 times a day**, circulating roughly **2,000 gallons of blood**. The electrical conduction system of the heart ensures a coordinated contraction of the atria and ventricles, enabling efficient blood flow."
