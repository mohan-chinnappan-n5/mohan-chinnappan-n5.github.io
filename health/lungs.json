        "The lungs are a pair of spongy organs located in the chest, responsible for taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. This process, called respiration, is essential for life and provides the body's cells with the oxygen they need to function.",
        "Each lung is divided into lobes, with the right lung having three lobes and the left lung having two. The left lung is slightly smaller to accommodate the heart."

        "The lungs are made up of branching airways, known as the bronchial tree. Starting with the trachea, air flows into the bronchi, which further divide into smaller bronchioles and end in alveoli, tiny air sacs where gas exchange occurs.",
        "The lungs are protected by the rib cage and are lined with a membrane called the pleura, which helps reduce friction as the lungs expand and contract during breathing."

      "title": "Function of the Lungs",
      "content": [
        "The primary function of the lungs is to perform gas exchange. Oxygen from inhaled air passes through the alveolar walls and enters the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide from the blood is expelled through exhalation.",
        "The lungs also help regulate the body's pH levels by controlling the release of carbon dioxide, a byproduct of cellular metabolism that can make the blood acidic."

      "content": [
        "Avoid smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, as smoking is one of the leading causes of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer.",
        "Exercise regularly to improve lung capacity and efficiency. Aerobic exercises like walking, running, and swimming help strengthen the respiratory muscles.",
        "Avoid air pollution and allergens that can damage lung tissue. Use a mask when necessary, especially in areas with high pollution or when using strong chemicals.",
        "Practice deep breathing exercises to help increase lung capacity and improve oxygen flow."
