## What is Hyperthyroidism?
- Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.
- Affects metabolism, causing symptoms like weight loss, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness.
- Common causes include Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, and thyroiditis.

# Slide 2
## Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism
- Rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)
- Unintentional weight loss
- Increased appetite
- Sweating and heat intolerance
- Nervousness, anxiety, or irritability

# Slide 3
## Causes of Hyperthyroidism
### Graves' Disease
- An autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the thyroid, causing overproduction of hormones.
### Thyroid Nodules
- Lumps in the thyroid that can produce excess thyroid hormone.
### Thyroiditis
- Inflammation of the thyroid, often temporary, leading to hormone release into the bloodstream.

# Slide 4
## Diagnosis
- Blood tests measure thyroid hormone levels (T3, T4) and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone).
- Imaging tests like thyroid scans or ultrasounds to identify nodules or inflammation.
- Physical exam for symptoms like goiter or rapid pulse.

# Slide 5
## Treatment Options
- **Antithyroid Medications:** Methimazole or propylthiouracil to reduce hormone production.
- **Radioactive Iodine:** Destroys overactive thyroid cells, often leading to hypothyroidism.
- **Beta-Blockers:** Manage symptoms like rapid heartbeat.
- **Surgery:** Thyroidectomy in severe cases or when other treatments fail.

## Lifestyle Management
- Eat a balanced diet, avoiding excess iodine.
- Manage stress through relaxation techniques or therapy.
- Regular exercise to support overall health and metabolism.
- Monitor symptoms and follow up with healthcare providers regularly.

- Thyroid storm: A rare, life-threatening condition with severe symptoms.
- Increased risk of pregnancy complications if untreated.

# Slide 8
## Prevention and Awareness
- Regular check-ups for early detection, especially if family history exists.
- Be aware of symptoms and seek medical advice promptly.
- Maintain a healthy lifestyle to support thyroid health.
- Educate yourself and others about thyroid disorders.

# Slide 9
