        "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. The goal is to maximize a cumulative reward signal over time.",
        "Key elements of RL include the **agent** (decision-maker), **environment** (context in which the agent operates), **states** (situations the agent can be in), **actions** (choices available to the agent), and **rewards** (feedback for actions)."

        "1. **Interaction with Environment**: The agent observes the current state and takes an action based on its policy (strategy).",
        "2. **Reward and Feedback**: The environment provides feedback in the form of a reward signal and a new state.",
        "3. **Learning through Trial and Error**: The agent uses this feedback to update its policy, aiming to maximize the cumulative reward over time.",
        "Popular algorithms in RL include **Q-Learning**, **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, and **Policy Gradient Methods**."

        "1. **Robotics**: RL is used to teach robots tasks such as walking, grasping, and navigation in complex environments.",
        "2. **Games**: RL has achieved human-level performance in games like Chess, Go, and video games (e.g., DeepMind’s AlphaGo and OpenAI’s Dota 2 bot).",
        "3. **Recommendation Systems**: Online platforms use RL to personalize user recommendations based on interactions.",
        "4. **Finance**: RL is applied for portfolio management, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment.",
        "5. **Healthcare**: RL aids in optimizing treatment plans, drug discovery, and resource allocation in hospitals."
