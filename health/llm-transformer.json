      "content": [
        "The Transformer is a deep learning architecture introduced in the paper *'Attention is All You Need'* by Vaswani et al. It revolutionized natural language processing by relying on attention mechanisms rather than recurrent or convolutional neural networks.",
        "Key components of the Transformer include:",
        "- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: Encoders process the input data, while decoders generate the output.",
        "- **Attention Mechanisms**: Captures relationships between all words in a sequence, regardless of their distance.",
        "- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about word order, since Transformers do not process sequences sequentially like RNNs."

      "title": "Self-Attention: The Core of the Transformer",
      "content": [
        "Self-attention allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when making predictions. For each word, the model computes a weighted sum of all words in the sequence, emphasizing the most contextually relevant ones.",
        "Steps in self-attention:",
        "1. **Query, Key, Value Representation**: Each word is transformed into three vectors: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V).",
        "2. **Attention Score Calculation**: The dot product of Q and K determines how much focus one word should give to another.",
        "3. **Weighted Sum**: Attention scores are used to scale V, resulting in a context-aware representation for each word."

      "content": [
        "Multi-head attention improves the model's ability to capture diverse relationships in the data. Instead of a single attention mechanism, it uses multiple attention 'heads' to learn different types of contextual information simultaneously.",
        "Advantages of multi-head attention:",

        "1. **Scalability**: Transformers are well-suited for parallel processing, making them efficient for training on large datasets.",
        "2. **Context Awareness**: Attention mechanisms enable a nuanced understanding of context, improving model performance on diverse tasks.",
        "3. **Adaptability**: The same architecture can be used for different tasks like translation, summarization, and generation.",
        "4. **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: Enables the development of pre-trained LLMs that can be fine-tuned for specific applications."
