        "TopP, also known as nucleus sampling, limits the pool of candidate tokens by their cumulative probability. It dynamically adjusts the size of the token pool based on a probability threshold P.",
        "Steps involved in TopP sampling:",
        "1. Sort tokens by probability in descending order.",
        "2. Select the smallest set of tokens where their cumulative probability exceeds P.",
        "3. Randomly sample from this subset.",
        "For example, if P=0.85 and token probabilities are: cat (0.40), dog (0.30), car (0.15), rat (0.10), only 'cat', 'dog', and 'car' would be considered since their cumulative probability is greater than 0.85."

      "content": [
        "1. **Token Selection**: TopP uses cumulative probability, while TopK selects a fixed number of tokens.",
        "2. **Diversity**: TopP adapts dynamically based on probabilities, whereas TopK provides a fixed pool size.",
        "3. **Flexibility**: TopP is more flexible, adjusting to context, while TopK is more rigid.",
