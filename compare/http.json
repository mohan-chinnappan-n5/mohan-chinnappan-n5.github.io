        "Widely supported across all devices and platforms.",

        "title": "Head-of-Line Blocking in HTTP/1.1",
        "description": "In HTTP/1.1, only one request can be processed per connection at a time. Even though HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections (allowing multiple requests to be sent over the same TCP connection), these requests must be processed sequentially. This leads to Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking, where one slow or large response can block all subsequent requests until it is fully delivered. This becomes inefficient when multiple resources are needed to load a modern web page, causing delays in page load times."

        "title": "Head-of-Line Blocking in HTTP/2.0",
        "description": "While HTTP/2 improves upon HTTP/1.1 by introducing multiplexing, it still suffers from Head-of-Line blocking at the TCP layer. Multiplexing allows multiple requests to be sent simultaneously over a single connection, but since all these requests share the same underlying TCP connection, any packet loss at the TCP level can block the delivery of subsequent packets for all streams, leading to HOL blocking at the transport layer. This can be mitigated by using HTTP/3, which operates over QUIC, a protocol that eliminates HOL blocking by using independent streams over UDP."
