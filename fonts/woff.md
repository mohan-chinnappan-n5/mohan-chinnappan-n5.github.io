A WOFF file, short for "Web Open Font Format," is a font file format used for delivering fonts on the web. It was developed to overcome some of the limitations and issues associated with using other font formats on websites, such as TrueType (TTF) and OpenType (OTF) fonts. WOFF files are designed to be more compact and to work well in web environments, ensuring consistent and attractive typography.

Key characteristics of WOFF files include:

1. Compression: WOFF files are compressed, which reduces their file size and makes them quicker to download and use on web pages.

2. Web-specific: WOFF files are optimized for web use, and they contain metadata and other information necessary for web font rendering, such as hinting instructions.

3. Licensing: Just like other font formats, WOFF files can be protected by copyright and licensing agreements. Users should ensure they have the proper rights to use a particular font on their website.

4. Browser Support: WOFF has broad browser support, making it a reliable choice for web developers and designers. Most modern web browsers can display WOFF fonts without issues.

5. Subsettable: You can subset a WOFF font to include only the specific characters and symbols you need for a website, reducing the file size even further.

WOFF files have become the preferred format for web fonts because they strike a balance between file size, browser compatibility, and ease of use, making them a practical choice for delivering custom fonts on websites.
