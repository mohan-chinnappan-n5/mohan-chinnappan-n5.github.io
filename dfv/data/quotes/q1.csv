"Mohandas Gandhi","I must say that, beyond occasionally exposing me to laughter, my constitutional shyness has been no dis-advantage whatever. In fact I can see that, on the contrary, it has been all to my advantage. My hesitancy in speech, which was once an annoyance, is now a pleasure. Its greatest benefit has been that it has taught me the economy of words. I have naturally formed the habit of restraining my thoughts. And I can now give myself the certificate that a thoughtless word hardly ever escapes my tongue or pen. I do not recollect ever having had to regret anything in my speech or writing. I have thus been spared many a mishap and waste of time. Experience has taught me that silence is part of the spiritual discipline of a votary of truth. Proneness to exaggerate, to suppress or modify the truth, wittingly or unwittingly, is a natural weakness of man, and silence is necessary in order to surmount it. A man of few words will rarely be thoughtless in his speech; he will measure every word. We find so many people impatient to talk. There is no chairman of a meeting who is not pestered with notes for permission to speak. And whenever the permission is given the speaker generally exceeds the time-limit, asks for more time, and keeps on talking without permission. All this talking can hardly be said to be of any benefit to the world. It is so much waste of time. My shyness has been in reality my shield and buckler. It has allowed me to grow. It has helped me in my discernment of truth."

"Mohandas Gandhi","The path is the goal."
"Mohandas Gandhi","The inner voice is something which cannot be described in words.  But sometimes we have a positive feeling that something in us prompts us to do a certain thing.  The time when I learnt to recognise this voice was, I may say, the time when I started praying regularly."
"Mohandas Gandhi","The seeker after truth should be humbler than the dust. The world crushes the dust under its feet, but the seeker after truth should so humble himself that even the dust could crush him. Only then, and not till then, will he have a glimpse of truth."
"Mohandas Gandhi","The only tyrant I accept in this world is the 'still small voice' within me. And even though I have to face the prospect of being a minority of one, I humbly believe I have the courage to be in such a hopeless minority."
"Mohandas Gandhi","Liberty and democracy become unholy when their hands are dyed red with innocent blood."

"Mohandas Gandhi","In a gentle way you can shake the world."
"Mohandas Gandhi","Ethically they had arrived at the conclusion  that man's supremacy over lower animals meant not that the former should prey upon the latter, but that the higher should protect the lower, and that there should be mutual aid between the two as between man and man. They had also brought out the truth that man eats not for enjoyment but to live."
"Mohandas Gandhi","Nothing has saddened me so much in life as the hardness of heart of educated people."
"Mohandas Gandhi","A customer is the most important visitor on our premises. He is not dependent on us. We are dependent on him. He is not an interruption in our work. He is the purpose of it. He is not an outsider in our business. He is part of it. We are not doing him a favor by serving him. He is doing us a favor by giving us an opportunity to do so."
"Mohandas Gandhi","Honest differences are often a healthy sign of progress."
"Mohandas Gandhi","A thousand candles can be lighted from the flame of one candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness can be spread without diminishing that of yourself."
"Mohandas Gandhi","Happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony."
"Mohandas Gandhi","If I were asked to define the Hindu creed, I should simply say: Search after truth through non-violent means. A man may not believe in God and still call himself a Hindu.
