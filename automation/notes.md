Playwright is cross-browser and Puppeteer was only done for Chrome. Not all the Puppeteer APIs and abstractions made sense for cross-browser story. Playwright aims at testing: we wait for elements to be interactable when we click, etc. That's a significant change in philosophy, so maintaining the API would be misleading.
