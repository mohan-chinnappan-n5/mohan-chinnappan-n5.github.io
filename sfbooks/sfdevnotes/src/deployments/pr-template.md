# pull request (PR) template

- All good projects have PR template

## Steps
- Create ```.github/pull_request_template.md``` in your project repo 
- Here is a sample [.github/pull_request_template.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohan-chinnappan-n/quotes/main/.github/pull_request_template.md)
```
- [ ] I completed my code review with my peers
- [ ] I completed code scan as explained [here](https://github.com/mohan-chinnappan-n/cli-dx/blob/master/mdapi/pmd-codescan.md)
- [ ] I validated the test code coverage for correctness and any shortcuts to increase test code coverage **not** presented in the code
- [ ] I completed a checkOnly (-c) deployment and this code is deployable

```
