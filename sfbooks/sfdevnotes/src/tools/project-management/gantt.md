## Project Estimates
|Estimate|Comments|
|---|---|
|**Planning estimates**|It is a rough order of estimate(ROM). ROM is an approximation strategy that helps project managers present important financial estimates to clients and consumers. Helps in determining the feasibility of a project and is important for the decision-making process|
|**Backlog estimates**|Provides data on the amount of work that isn't complete - works has started but not yet completed|
|**Timebox estimates**|Shows  how long it might take to complete a project - important part of Agile and Lean software development. Involves subdividing a project into **smaller chunks of work** and estimating each chunk separately.|
|**Order-of-magnitude estimates**|Helps to estimate the cost and effort to complete a project - help you determine how big something is without knowing the exact value.|
|**Feasibility estimates**|useful when determining if a project or task is doable and how much it may cost|
|**Detailed estimates**|Includes several line items or categories of work for a project. You can use it to estimate the time and resources necessary to complete a project|
|**Analogous estimates**|uses experience to predict the time and cost required for a project. For example, if you've completed similar projects in the past and know how long each one took, you can use this information to estimate future projects|
|**Top-down estimates**|starts with a high-level project scope, which you simplify into smaller pieces.|
