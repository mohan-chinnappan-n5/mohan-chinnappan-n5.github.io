- A project member requests a change. They provide the details like the affected systems, possible risks, and expected implementation.
- The change manager or peers determine if the change will be successful. They may ask for more information in this step.
- After review, the team plans how to put the change in place. They record details about:
    - the expected outcomes 
    - resources needed
    - timeline
    - testing requirements
    - undo : ways to roll back the change

- Depending on the type of change and risk, a **change approval board (CAB)** may need to review the plan.
- The team works to implement the change, documenting their procedures and results.
- The **change manager** reviews and closes the implemented change. 
    - They note whether it was successful, timely, accurately estimated, within budget, and other details.
