# Lightning Experience Queries

## Terms
-  Experienced Page Time ([EPT](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.technical_requirements_ept.htm&type=5)) is a performance metric Salesforce uses in Lightning to measure page load time. EPT measures how long it takes for a page to load into a state that a user can meaningfully interact with.

The EPT is measured as the time from the page start to when no more activity occurs for at least two frames (~33 ms). The two extra frames help to avoid false positives due to asynchronous calls. These calls include any XHR activity, any storage activity, or any user interaction or client-side work of any kind in the main JavaScript thread.
