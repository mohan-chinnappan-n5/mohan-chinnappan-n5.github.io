In Salesforce, policies in topics refer to the guidelines and rules that define what an AI agent can and cannot do within a specific topic. These policies help ensure that the agent operates within the desired boundaries and adheres to business rules. Here are some key points:

- Role Definition: Policies help define the agent's role and the broader goals it should achieve.
- Data Access: Policies specify what data the agent can access and under what circumstances.
- Action Execution: Policies outline the actions the agent can perform and any restrictions on those actions.
- Security and Compliance: Policies ensure that the agent's actions comply with security and regulatory requirements.
