In Agentforce, a **topic** refers to a specific subject or area of interest that an autonomous agent can handle. Topics help define the scope of tasks and interactions that the agent can manage. 

## Here are some key points about topics in Agentforce:

1. **Task Definition**: Topics are used to specify the tasks that an agent is responsible for. For example, a topic could be "customer support," "order processing," or "appointment scheduling."
2. **Natural Language Instructions**: Each topic includes natural language instructions that guide the agent on how to handle specific queries or actions related to that topic.
3. **Action Library**: Topics are associated with a library of actions that the agent can select from to perform tasks. These actions can include workflows, automations, or API calls.
4. **Customization**: Topics can be customized using tools like Agent Builder, allowing users to define and refine the tasks and actions that the agent can perform.
5. **Monitoring and Testing**: Topics can be monitored and tested within the Agent Builder to ensure that the agent's responses and actions are accurate and effective.
