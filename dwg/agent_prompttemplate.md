A prompt template in Salesforce is a reusable set of instructions designed to guide a large language model (LLM) to return useful results. Here are some key points:

- Customization: Build and customize prompt templates to fit specific business needs.
- Data Grounding: Ground prompts with your own data to get more accurate and relevant responses.
- Integration: Use prompt templates across various Salesforce tools and workflows, including Agentforce and Flow Builder.
