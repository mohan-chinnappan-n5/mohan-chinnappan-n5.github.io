In Salesforce, an "agent action" refers to the predefined tasks that an autonomous AI agent can execute to fulfill its role. These actions can include running flows, executing prompt templates, or performing Apex code. Here are some key points:

- Predefined Tasks: Actions are specific tasks that an agent can perform based on a trigger or instruction.
- Execution: Actions enable agents to execute logic and integrate with external systems.
- Customization: Developers can build custom actions using code, APIs, flows, and prompt templates.
