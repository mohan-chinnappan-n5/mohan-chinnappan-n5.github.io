The purpose of Agent Builder in Agentforce is to provide a low-code platform for building and customizing AI agents. Here are some key functionalities:

1. Customization: Easily customize out-of-the-box agents or build new agents for any role, industry, or use case using existing tools like Flows, Prompts, Apex, and MuleSoft APIs.
2. Task Definition: Define the tasks your agent will perform by setting natural language topics, instructions, and actions.
3. Testing and Monitoring: Observe and test the agent's plan of action and responses within the Agent Builder.
4. Integration: Integrate with various data sources and systems to ensure the agent has access to all necessary information.
