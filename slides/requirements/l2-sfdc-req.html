 When developing a Salesforce solution, Level 2 (L2) requirements would provide more detailed and specific information about what the Salesforce solution should do. These requirements can encompass various aspects of the solution, including functionality, user experience, data management, and integration. Here are some sample L2 requirements for a Salesforce solution:
---
1. **User Authentication and Access Control:**
   - L2 Requirement: Implement single sign-on (SSO) functionality for users to log in using their corporate credentials.
   - L2 Requirement: Define role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific Salesforce objects and features based on user roles and profiles.
---
2. **Lead and Opportunity Management:**
   - L2 Requirement: Create custom lead and opportunity record types to capture industry-specific information.
   - L2 Requirement: Implement lead conversion automation rules to streamline the process from lead to opportunity.
---
3. **Workflow and Automation:**
   - L2 Requirement: Configure workflow rules to automatically assign leads to the appropriate sales representatives based on lead attributes.
   - L2 Requirement: Create time-based workflow actions to send automated follow-up emails to leads and opportunities at key stages.
---
4. **Custom Reporting and Dashboards:**
   - L2 Requirement: Develop custom reports and dashboards to track sales performance, including conversion rates, pipeline value, and lead sources.
   - L2 Requirement: Enable users to schedule and automate the delivery of reports via email.
---
5. **Integration with External Systems:**
   - L2 Requirement: Integrate Salesforce with the company's ERP system to synchronize customer data in real-time.
   - L2 Requirement: Implement a middleware solution to connect Salesforce with third-party marketing automation software for lead nurturing.
---
6. **Data Management:**
   - L2 Requirement: Define data validation rules to ensure data integrity, such as requiring valid email addresses and phone numbers for lead records.
   - L2 Requirement: Set up data deduplication and cleansing processes to maintain a clean database.
---
7. **Customization and Extensibility:**
   - L2 Requirement: Allow for custom fields and objects to accommodate unique business processes and data requirements.
   - L2 Requirement: Develop Apex triggers and classes to automate complex business logic not achievable through standard configuration.
---
8. **User Training and Documentation:**
   - L2 Requirement: Provide comprehensive user training materials, including video tutorials and user guides, to onboard and educate users effectively.
   - L2 Requirement: Schedule hands-on training sessions for different user groups to ensure they can effectively use the Salesforce solution.
---
9. **Performance and Scalability:**
   - L2 Requirement: Optimize Salesforce configurations and code for performance, ensuring quick response times even with a large dataset.
   - L2 Requirement: Plan for scalability by assessing the solution's ability to handle increased user and data volumes over time.
---
10. **Security and Compliance:**
    - L2 Requirement: Implement data encryption at rest and in transit to meet data security standards and compliance requirements.
    - L2 Requirement: Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
---
These are just examples of L2 requirements for a Salesforce solution. The actual requirements will depend on the specific needs and goals of the organization and the complexity of the Salesforce implementation. Effective requirements gathering and documentation are essential to ensure a successful Salesforce solution development project.
