In the context of requirements engineering or software development, "L1" and "L2" level requirements typically refer to different levels or types of requirements documentation. These levels are often used in complex systems to categorize and manage requirements effectively. However, the specific meaning of "L1" and "L2" can vary depending on the organization and industry. Here's a general understanding:
---
1. **L1 Requirements (Level 1 Requirements):**
   - L1 requirements are often referred to as high-level requirements or system-level requirements.
   - They provide a broad overview of the system's functionality and purpose.
---
   - L1 requirements are typically less detailed and are meant to convey the project's goals and objectives.
   - They are often written in non-technical language and can be understood by stakeholders who may not have a technical background.
   - L1 requirements help set the project's scope and direction.
---
2. **L2 Requirements (Level 2 Requirements):**
   - L2 requirements are more detailed and specific than L1 requirements.
   - They are derived from the high-level L1 requirements and provide a more granular description of what the system should do.
---
   - L2 requirements are often written in a way that allows for easier translation into design and development tasks.
   - They may include functional requirements, performance requirements, security requirements, and other technical specifications.
   - L2 requirements are usually meant for technical teams and developers who will implement the system.
---
In some cases, organizations may use additional levels of requirements documentation, such as L3, L4, and so on, to further break down and detail the requirements as needed. The specific naming and structure of requirement levels can vary across different industries and organizations. The goal is to provide a clear and structured way to manage and communicate the requirements throughout the project's lifecycle.
---
It's important to note that the terminology and categorization of requirements can vary, and some organizations may use different labels or approaches to document and manage requirements. The key is to have a well-defined and consistent process for capturing, analyzing, and documenting requirements to ensure successful project outcomes.
