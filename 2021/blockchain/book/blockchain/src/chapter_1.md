A blockchain is a growing list of records, called **blocks**, that are linked together using **cryptography**

Cryptography
- Communication in the presence of adversaries

It is essentially a **digital ledger of transactions** that is 
  - duplicated 
  -  distributed 
across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to **every participantâ€™s ledger**. 

This de-centralized database managed by **multiple participants** is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).


## Features

- Distributed
    - All the participants have a local copy of the ledger for the completed transparency

- Immutable
    - Any validated records immutable, can't be changed/updated

- Time-stamped
    - All the transactions are time-stamped 
    
- Programmable 
    - Smart Contracts

- Secure
    - All records are encrypted

- Anonymous
    - Identity of the participants are 
        - Anonymous or PseudoAnonymous
- Unanimous
    - All the participants agree to the validity of the each records
