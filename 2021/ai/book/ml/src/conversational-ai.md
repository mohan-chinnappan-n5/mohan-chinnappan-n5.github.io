> Teaching computers to communicate more like humans and not the other way around - Cathy Pearl - Google Conversation Design Outreach

> There is no great writing, only great rewriting

- Guide the user to the success by showing them the type of things they are going to be able to say in order for the system to respond.



- Start with a sample dialog (like movie script) between the user and the  system
- Flesh out Ideas and make sure you are in the right direction
- Iterate over this sample dialog to make it perfect
- Do a [table read](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-a-table-read-how-to-set-up-a-table-read-including-who-to-invite-and-what-to-provide)
    - someone play user role
    - you play the system role
    - find out the gaps and fix it 

- Prepare for:
    - User will say things you did not expect
    - In human-to-human conversation, we repair the conversations and move forward 
    - So repair things gracefully when user says you did not expect and get them back on track and keep going

> User: I have issue a billing issue
> System: Provide current options available right now at this point in the conversation 

- Rapid re-prompt

> **User**: I like chocolate

> *System*: You like Milk or Dark chocolate?

> **User**: 65%

> *System*: Sorry, it was Milk chocolate or Dark chocolate?

```
Do not say: I did not get that.
Be more specific and what was the system expecting at that time
and how the user can get back on track

```
