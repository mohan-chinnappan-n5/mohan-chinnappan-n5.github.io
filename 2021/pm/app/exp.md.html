We need an awesome "Global Music Data" to become major player in 
entertainment industry world! 
```

```
How we designed CID (Component ID) in component information system to identify
any component in the world,  MusicID (32-bit number) will identify any music in the world!

```

- [US Patent US7555447B2 - System and method for identifying a product - Mohanasundaram Chinnappan, Manoel Tenorio ](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7555447B2/en?inventor=Mohanasundaram+Chinnappan&oq=inventor:(Mohanasundaram+Chinnappan))

```
The Gracenote search engine answers more queries per day than any other search engine, 
save Google (even more than Yahoo!, MSN, AOL and all the others). 
When you consider all types of user queries, 
the Gracenote service handles far more queries on any given day than 
even Google does in all of its services combined.
- Steve Scherf -  Co-founder of Gracenote

```

- **Gracenote Global Music Data** is the most comprehensive collection of factual and descriptive metadata for the most popular music worldwide.

- With deep, clean data and standardized artist and recording IDs, Gracenote enables entertainment services to simplify how fans *find, discover, and connect* with more of the music they love.


- Gracenote **MusicID** is the standard for music recognition in the car, powering the music experience in **120 million vehicles and counting**. 

- With MusicID, drivers and passengers can easily identify and navigate all of their favorite jams, from any device, while keeping their eyes on the road.

## MusicID CD
- When a driver pops a CD into their car audio system 
- Gracenote MusicID CD recognizes the disc and delivers the correct artist, album and track names, as well as **Album Cover Art** to the dashboard display

## MusicID File
- Gracenote MusicID File scans music on smartphones when drivers connect by USB and Bluetooth. 
- Once identified, Gracenote enables drivers to browse and play music using **voice and touch** commands.

## Voice Recognition
- Gracenote has **deep data** to help drive voice intelligence. 
- With a database describing **millions of artists and tracks**, as well as thousands of artist nicknames and aliases, voice systems can get hip with names like Wu-Tang and Fiddy.

- Once music is identified by MusicID CD or MusicID File, Gracenote algorithms can transform music stored on mobile phones into killer playlists organized by similar Genres, Moods and Tempos.


## Integration
 - Help 3rd party companies to integrate **Gracenote metadata** into their applications and systems leveraged by the biggest entertainment brands around the globe. 

## Gracenote Sports
## Gracenote Video

- **Importance vs Satisfaction with current alternatives**


Importance |  Satisfaction  | Comments|
---|---|---|
**High**|**Low**|**Opportunity**|
High|High|Competitive Market|
Low|Low|Not worth going after|
Low|High|Not worth going after|


## 3. Value Proposition - Iterations

Item|Must-to-have|Perf benefits|Wow|Competitor|Ours|
---|---|---|---|---|
metadata search engine response within 150 milliseconds|Y|-|N|NA|v 1.0|
metadata search engine response within 100 milliseconds|N|Y|N|NA|v 1.2|
search based on nicknames and aliases|N|N|Y|NA|v 1.3|
voice based on search|N|N|Y|NA|v 1.4|
user mood based auto search|N|N|Y|NA|v 2.0 or later|

## 4. MVP Feature Set
- Hands free operation for the vehicle drivers
- Enable drivers to browse and play music using **voice and touch** commands.
- Do not over build before we realize we are going in wrong direction!

### Plan for the MVP
Item|Must-to-have|Perf benefits|Wow|Competitor|Ours|
---|---|---|---|---|
metadata search engine response within 150 milliseconds|Y|-|N|NA|v 1.0|

- MVP to have v1.0 features

- **UX**
- Brings the functionality and Product to *LIFE*

## 5. MVP Prototype

- Use Click and Touch prototyping tools like Figma, In-vision without writing code

![Prototyping tools](img/prototyping-tools.png)

## 6. Test MVP with the customers
```
Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive.
- Andy Grove
```


- Few customers requested v1.0 search performance improvements less than 100 milliseconds
- Re-architect the content framework to meet this requirements 
- Re-test the updated MVP with the customers

-   Roadmap
    - Project Goals (Epics ![epic](img/epic.svg))
        - Issues (user stories, bugs, tasks)
 
- Turn the big goals into achievable outcomes so our team can get more done, more often. 
- The roadmap helps us to plan, track, and visualize our project goals, which we call epics. 
- The epics are then broken down into small, actionable chunks of work.
    - Breakdown a goal so you can categorize, assign and move work forward, bit by bit. 
    - In Jira Software, *chunks of work* are called *issues*. 
    ![chucks](img/small-chuncks.svg)
    ![epic-2-work](img/epic-2-work.gif)
    - There are different types of issues, like 
        - user stories
        - bugs
        - tasks

```
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.
