have a realistic vision of what success of their product means and they ensure that this vision becomes reality - **whatever it takes**|have lots of excuses, like blaming Engineering manager...|

understand and balance a wide variety of factors that affect product **strategy and execution**||
understand the capabilities and limitations of their overall company| |
knows approximately how much and what kind of marketing resources the company will spend on these products. Don't always know the answer to these questions, but they know enough to ask right folks|build a product that will take too long to pay off|

Get the compelling value proposition for the customer!

```

Good|Bad|
---|---|
 **listen to customers** but probe deeper into the underlying problems to get at the **compelling value proposition** for the customer. *If you had a noisy car you might ask for a louder stereo, but you would probably be a lot happier with a quieter car* |ask customers leading questions and get biased answers. Go on their instinct and "confirm" it with two unusual customers|
also know what customers can & will **pay for**|build a good product for a market their company isn't in|
certain that if they build a certain product, **customers will buy it**. |build a product that's too complex for their company to sell. Aren't savvy or confident enough to distinguish between interest. Blindly listen to the loudest customers, and define a product that addresses yesterday's needs of a handful of companies.and commitment to buy. Compare future products to today's competition, or cite advantages customers don't care about. |
go the extra mile to make sure they get this right||

A fact is a statement that can be proven true or false. 
An opinion is an expression of a person’s feelings that cannot be proven. 
Opinions can be based on facts or emotions and
sometimes they are meant to deliberately mislead others.

It is impossible to plan a project without making a few assumptions. 
The key is knowing how to spot those assumptions and putting safeguards 
in place so that if any assumption is proven false, 
the impact on project delivery will be minimal.

- Project Management Institute (PMI)

```

Good|Bad|
---|---|
define clearly and in as much detail as is necessary what the product should do, how fast it should be, etc.| cut corners on communication with engineering or misunderstand their role.  |
don't forget to specify critical information.||
willing to explain the obvious to make sure it's understood.||
specify the whole product, including release criteria, platforms, etc., not only the new features||
sense and tackle hard issues - **in writing - early in the development process** ||
production information  based on research, information and a logical, transparent
thought process that the entire team buys into||
know that engineers are scientists by nature and **value data much more than opinion**. other
parts of PD (QA, Doc, etc.) should be involved in that process. ||
define a clear product vision and target that empowers engineering to fill in the details that are difficult to specify or anticipate.||
explain why engineering should build a particular product a particular way.|They want light and ask for a candle when their engineers could have built a light bulb.|
respected by their engineering teams. Engineering teams involve good product managers in difficult decisions. ||
Written communication to engineering is superior because it is more consistent across an entire product team, it is more lasting, it raises accountability. | put off hard decisions until the end of the product cycle|
attend product team meetings regularly and make sure they're around when engineering is making tradeoffs. |change engineering priorities based on the latest customer feedback or latest hot sales situation without going through the defined process|

  Good|Bad|
---|---|
keep PRDs up-to-date daily or weekly at a minimum.  Good product managers **view the entire PRD process as a living ongoing process**, because it is (engineering has new questions, market conditions change, etc.). If anything changes in the PRD, a good product manager **communicates the change clearly to the entire product team**| write a PRD and assume engineering understands it.
don't rest until they are sure that the **product vision is consistent across** product management, engineering, QA, tech pubs, and support and is reflected in the PRD. They don't rest, because they know that **no great product ever emerged from a broad set of conflicting visions**|managers don't have time to update their PRD. update the PRD and don't tell anyone, or don't tell enough people, or don't explain why.|
