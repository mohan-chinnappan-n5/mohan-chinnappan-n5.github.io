## Evolution from Einstein Copilot to Agentforce

Salesforce has introduced **Agentforce**, an evolution of its generative AI-powered assistant, Einstein Copilot, designed to enhance customer relationship management (CRM). Einstein Copilot leveraged [**Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT)**](https://mohan-chinnappan-n5.github.io/sf/agentforce/agentforce.html?data=agentforce.md&ref=ref.json&vids=vids.json#CoT) to generate plans with a sequence of steps to achieve user goals. While effective in task automation, it fell short in areas of adaptability, conversational depth, and scalability.

Key insights gained from rigorous testing with Salesforce's internal sales team (Org 62) highlighted these limitations:
1. Copilot excelled at fulfilling predefined goals but lacked true conversational flexibility.
2. Contextual awareness was limited, making it difficult to handle follow-up inquiries effectively.
3. Performance degraded with an increasing number of use cases, leading to slower response times and reduced quality.

Agentforce addresses these challenges with improved conversational intelligence, adaptability, and scalability, marking a significant step toward a more human-like AI assistant.

### Comparison: Einstein Copilot vs. Agentforce

| Feature/Capability       | **Einstein Copilot**                                                                                         | **Agentforce**                                                                                       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reasoning Mechanism**   | Chain-of-Thought reasoning: Executes pre-planned steps sequentially.                                         | Enhanced conversational AI with dynamic adaptability.                                                |
| **Conversational Depth**  | Limited conversational flexibility; struggled with follow-up inquiries.                                      | Better use of context for nuanced and conversational responses.                                      |
| **Adaptability**          | Lacked the ability to dynamically adjust plans or ask users for redirection.                                | Adaptive responses that integrate user-provided information in real time.                            |
| **Scalability**           | Performance degraded with increased actions and use cases.                                                  | Scales effectively to thousands of applications without compromising latency or response quality.    |
| **Human-Like Interaction**| Superior to traditional bots but not fully human-like.                                                      | Closer to human-like intelligence with more natural and seamless interactions.                        |

Agentforce represents a transformative leap in AI-powered CRM, setting a new standard for conversational assistants.
