**Reasoning Engine** is an AI system designed to simulate human decision-making and problem-solving based on rules, data, and logic. It mimics three main types of human reasoning: 
- **Deductive** (from general facts to specific conclusions)
- **Inductive** (from specific cases to general conclusions)
- **Abductive** (making a probable conclusion from incomplete data)

The type of reasoning in the statement:

**"All birds lay eggs. A pigeon is a bird. Therefore, pigeons lay eggs."**

is **deductive reasoning**.

### Explanation:
- **Deductive reasoning** works from general premises to reach a specific conclusion.
- In this case:
  1. General premise: "All birds lay eggs."
  2. Specific instance: "A pigeon is a bird."
  3. Conclusion: "Pigeons lay eggs."

The conclusion is logically certain because it follows directly from the premises. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.

---

The type of reasoning in the statement:

**"Every dog I meet is friendly. Therefore, all dogs are friendly!"**

is **inductive reasoning**.

### Explanation:
- **Inductive reasoning** involves drawing a general conclusion based on specific observations or examples.
- In this case:
  1. Specific observation: "Every dog I meet is friendly."
  2. General conclusion: "All dogs are friendly."

The conclusion is not guaranteed to be true, as it extrapolates beyond the observed data. Inductive reasoning often leads to probable, rather than certain, conclusions, as the unobserved cases might differ.

---

The reasoning in the statement:

**"There are torn papers all over the floor and our dog was alone in the apartment. Therefore, the dog must have torn the papers."**

is **abductive reasoning**.

#### Explanation:
- **Abductive reasoning** involves forming a hypothesis that provides the best explanation for a set of observations. It does not guarantee that the conclusion is correct, but it offers the most plausible explanation based on the given evidence.
- In this case:
  1. **Observation**: Torn papers are all over the floor.
  2. **Condition**: The dog was the only one in the apartment.
  3. **Hypothesis**: The dog must have torn the papers.

While this is a plausible explanation, it is not necessarily the only explanation (e.g., a strong wind or another cause might be responsible). Abductive reasoning is often used in problem-solving and diagnostic situations.

---
In Salesforce, reasoning engines often use large language models (LLMs) to process information and generate logical inferences. For example, an LLM could help a business owner calculate the number of products they need to sell to break even by applying a set of known rules and mathematical formulas. LLMs can also employ advanced reasoning strategies such as [**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903) or [**Reasoning and Acting (ReAct)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629), which break down complex problems into manageable steps.

## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning** is a reasoning strategy in artificial intelligence, particularly in large language models (LLMs), that involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, sequential steps. Instead of attempting to produce a direct answer to a problem, CoT reasoning enables the AI to solve problems by reasoning through intermediate steps in a logical and structured manner.

---

### Key Features of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
1. **Step-by-Step Process**:
   - The reasoning is performed incrementally, with each step building on the previous one.
   - This mimics how humans often solve complex problems by dividing them into manageable chunks.

2. **Transparency**:
   - The intermediate steps are explicitly represented, which makes the reasoning process more interpretable.
   - This is especially useful for debugging or understanding the AI's thought process.

3. **Complex Problem Solving**:
   - Particularly useful for problems requiring arithmetic, logical reasoning, or multi-step deductions.

4. **Improved Accuracy**:
   - By explicitly reasoning through intermediate steps, the AI reduces the likelihood of errors that might arise from jumping to conclusions.

---

### Example of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

#### Problem:
*If a library has 240 books and each shelf can hold 60 books, how many shelves are needed?*

#### CoT Reasoning:
1. Total books = 240.
2. Each shelf holds 60 books.
3. Divide the total books by the capacity per shelf: \( 240 \div 60 = 4 \).
4. Therefore, 4 shelves are needed.

---

### Applications of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
1. **Mathematical Problem Solving**:
   - Helps solve problems requiring multiple calculations or logical deductions.
   
2. **Question Answering Systems**:
   - Allows for reasoning about facts and drawing conclusions in stages.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - Supports reasoning through the implications of different choices or scenarios.

4. **Conversational AI**:
   - Improves responses by reasoning through user inputs step by step.

---

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning vs. Other Strategies:
- **Direct Answering**:
  - In contrast to CoT, a direct answering approach jumps to a conclusion without explicitly outlining intermediate steps.
- **Reasoning and Acting (ReAct)**:
  - Combines reasoning and taking actions in an interactive environment, whereas CoT focuses on logical progression without immediate action.

---

### Benefits of CoT in AI Models:
1. **Enhanced Logical Capabilities**:
   - The AI can solve problems that are too complex for direct inference.
   
2. **Transparency**:
   - Makes the decision-making process more understandable for humans.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Adapts well to a wide range of tasks, including those in education, customer service, and business logic.

Chain-of-Thought reasoning is a critical development in AI, enabling systems to emulate human-like problem-solving in a structured, interpretable way.

## Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) 

**Reasoning and Acting (ReAct)** is a framework that combines **reasoning** (logical, step-by-step thinking) and **action** (interacting with an environment or tools) to solve complex problems. It is particularly useful in settings where an AI system needs to both think critically and take actions based on its reasoning to achieve a goal.

---

### Key Features of ReAct:
1. **Integration of Reasoning and Action**:
   - The AI alternates between reasoning (explaining its thought process) and acting (taking actions in an environment or executing commands).

2. **Step-by-Step Problem Solving**:
   - ReAct encourages the system to explicitly state intermediate thoughts and decisions, which helps improve the transparency and robustness of its decision-making process.

3. **Dynamic Interaction**:
   - The system can interact with its environment (e.g., querying databases, APIs, or simulated environments) to gather more information or execute commands that lead it closer to solving the problem.

4. **Improved Performance**:
   - By combining reasoning and acting, ReAct can handle tasks that require multi-step reasoning and dynamic interaction, such as:
     - Information retrieval
     - Complex planning
     - Diagnostic problem-solving

---

### How It Works:
1. **Reasoning**:
   - The AI generates explanations or logical steps to solve the problem.
   - Example: "To find the total sales, I need to add up all the individual sales amounts."

2. **Acting**:
   - The AI executes actions based on its reasoning, such as performing calculations, querying a database, or interacting with a tool.
   - Example: "Querying the database for sales records..."

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - The system observes the outcomes of its actions and uses them to refine its reasoning and decide on the next steps.

---

### Real-World Example:
- An AI system using ReAct might:
  1. Reason: "To optimize the sales pipeline, I need to identify underperforming leads."
  2. Act: Query the CRM to fetch lead conversion data.
  3. Reason: "Leads from a specific campaign have the lowest conversion rate."
  4. Act: Suggest specific actions (e.g., improving marketing materials for that campaign).

---

### Origin and Research:
ReAct was introduced by researchers at Princeton University and Google Research.

- **Paper Title**: *ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models*  
- **Authors**: Shinn et al.  
- **Published**: 2022  

---

### Why ReAct Matters:
- It makes AI more **intelligent**, **transparent**, and **reliable**.
- Combines the strength of logical reasoning with the practical ability to interact with dynamic environments.
- Useful in tasks like automation, customer service, and interactive applications.

## Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
![TOT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm/master/pics/teaser.png)

**Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** is a reasoning framework that extends the traditional linear "Chain of Thought" (CoT) approach by introducing **tree-based exploration** for solving complex problems. Instead of proceeding step-by-step in a single path, the model explores multiple possible reasoning paths simultaneously, evaluating and selecting the best one dynamically.

---

### Key Concepts:
1. **Tree Structure for Reasoning**:
   - ToT represents reasoning as a **tree**, where:
     - **Nodes**: Represent intermediate reasoning steps or partial solutions.
     - **Branches**: Represent possible choices or actions to take at each step.
   - The tree structure allows the model to explore **multiple pathways** to a solution, rather than being constrained to a single linear sequence.

2. **Exploration and Evaluation**:
   - The framework explores different reasoning paths and evaluates their potential outcomes.
   - It can backtrack or prune unpromising paths, focusing computational resources on the most likely solutions.

3. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - At each stage, the model uses heuristics or external evaluations to decide which branches to expand.
   - This iterative process improves the quality of reasoning and ensures optimal or near-optimal outcomes.

4. **Decision-Making under Uncertainty**:
   - By maintaining multiple reasoning pathways, ToT is well-suited for tasks where uncertainty or incomplete information exists.

---

### How It Works:
1. **Define the Problem**:
   - Break down the problem into smaller subproblems or decision points.

2. **Generate Initial Steps**:
   - The model proposes multiple potential steps or actions based on the problem context.

3. **Expand and Explore**:
   - Create a tree structure where each branch represents a possible continuation from the current state.

4. **Evaluate and Prune**:
   - Assess the quality of each pathway using predefined criteria or external evaluations.
   - Remove or deprioritize branches that are unlikely to lead to successful outcomes.

5. **Select the Optimal Path**:
   - Follow the most promising branch to reach the final solution.

---

### Applications of ToT:
1. **Complex Problem-Solving**:
   - E.g., Multi-step mathematical proofs, scientific hypothesis generation.
2. **Planning and Strategy**:
   - E.g., Task scheduling, game strategy development.
3. **Decision Support Systems**:
   - E.g., Medical diagnosis, business forecasting.
4. **Creative Tasks**:
   - E.g., Generating stories, brainstorming ideas.

| **Suitability**           | Simple problems            | Complex, multi-faceted problems |

---

### Advantages of ToT:
- Handles **complex, multi-step problems** better than CoT.
- Allows for **dynamic decision-making** with multiple contingencies.
- Provides a more **robust framework** for reasoning under uncertainty.

---

### Origins and Research:
- **Tree of Thoughts** is a recent advancement inspired by AI and cognitive science.
- Often tied to innovations in large language models (LLMs) and generative reasoning.
- Researchers are actively exploring its integration with reasoning engines like GPT and applications in diverse fields.
