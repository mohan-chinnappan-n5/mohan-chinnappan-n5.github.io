# Slide 1
## What Are Farm Animals?
- Farm animals are domesticated animals raised on farms for food, fiber, labor, or other products.
- Common examples include cows, chickens, pigs, sheep, and goats.
- Play a vital role in agriculture, supporting food security and economies worldwide.

# Slide 2
## Types of Farm Animals
- **Livestock:** Large animals like cows, pigs, and sheep for meat, milk, or wool.
- **Poultry:** Birds like chickens, ducks, and turkeys for eggs and meat.
- **Other Farm Animals:** Goats, horses, and rabbits for milk, labor, or fur.

# Slide 3
## Common Farm Animals
- **Cows (Bos taurus):** Raised for milk, beef, and leather; thrive in pastures.
- **Chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus):** Kept for eggs and meat; adaptable to various climates.
- **Pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus):** Raised for pork; prefer temperate to warm environments.

# Slide 4
## More Common Farm Animals
- **Sheep (Ovis aries):** Raised for wool, meat (lamb/mutton), and milk; thrive in grasslands.
- **Goats (Capra aegagrus hircus):** Kept for milk, meat, and fiber; hardy in diverse climates.
- **Horses (Equus caballus):** Used for labor, recreation, or breeding; require open spaces.

# Slide 5
## Farming Conditions
- **Climate:** Varies by species—cows and sheep prefer temperate climates, chickens adapt widely, pigs need warmth.
- **Housing:** Shelters like barns, coops, or pastures to protect from weather and predators.
- **Diet:** Balanced feed (grains, hay, supplements) tailored to each animal’s needs.
- **Space:** Adequate land or enclosures for grazing, movement, and health.

# Slide 6
## Care and Maintenance
- **Feeding:** Regular, species-specific diets to ensure growth and productivity.
- **Health Management:** Vaccinations, veterinary care, and parasite control.
- **Breeding:** Planned mating for healthy offspring and sustainable populations.
- **Grooming:** Shearing sheep, hoof care for horses, and hygiene for pigs and chickens.

# Slide 7
## Benefits of Farm Animals
- **Food Production:** Provide meat, milk, eggs, and dairy products (e.g., cheese, butter).
- **Fiber and Leather:** Wool from sheep, hides from cows, feathers from chickens.
- **Labor:** Horses and oxen for plowing and transportation in some regions.
- **Economic Value:** Support local and global agriculture, creating jobs and income.

# Slide 8
## Common Challenges
- **Diseases:** Bovine tuberculosis, avian flu, and swine fever can devastate herds/flocks.
- **Predators:** Wolves, foxes, and birds of prey threaten smaller animals like chickens.
- **Climate Change:** Extreme weather affects grazing, water supply, and animal health.
- **Overgrazing:** Poor land management can degrade pastures and soil quality.

# Slide 9
## Sustainable Farming Practices
- **Rotational Grazing:** Move animals to prevent overgrazing and improve soil health.
- **Organic Farming:** Use natural feed, avoid antibiotics, and promote biodiversity.
- **Animal Welfare:** Provide humane conditions, space, and stress-free environments.
- **Waste Management:** Use manure as fertilizer, reducing environmental impact.
