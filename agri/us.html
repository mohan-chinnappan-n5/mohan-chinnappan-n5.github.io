       <!-- Robotics and AI -->
       <section id="robotics-ai" class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Leveraging Robotics and AI</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Advanced technologies like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping agriculture. These innovations enable farmers to optimize 
            operations, increase efficiency, and reduce waste. Below are specific ways Robotics and AI are transforming agriculture:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>AI-Powered Monitoring:</strong> Sensors powered by AI monitor soil health, moisture levels, and nutrient content in real time. Farmers can act immediately to address deficiencies, reducing crop losses.</li>
            <li><strong>Precision Farming:</strong> Robots equipped with GPS and AI algorithms can plant seeds with extreme accuracy, minimizing waste and ensuring even distribution across fields.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Harvesting:</strong> Robotic harvesters use computer vision to identify and pick ripe fruits and vegetables. This reduces labor dependency and prevents damage to produce.</li>
            <li><strong>Pest and Disease Management:</strong> AI tools analyze patterns in crops and detect early signs of pests or diseases. Drone technology can then apply targeted treatments, reducing pesticide use.</li>
            <li><strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> AI processes vast amounts of agricultural data to provide actionable insights, such as the best planting times, ideal crop varieties, and optimized irrigation schedules.</li>
            <li><strong>Labor Shortage Solutions:</strong> With fewer workers entering farming, robots and AI provide reliable, scalable alternatives for tasks like weeding, pruning, and packing produce.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">
            These advancements not only increase yields but also make farming more sustainable and resilient to climate change. By reducing resource usage and enhancing productivity, Robotics and AI are paving the way for a smarter, greener future in agriculture.

     <!-- Water Management -->
     <section id="water-management" class="mb-8">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Efficient Water Management</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Water is one of the most critical resources in agriculture, and managing it efficiently is key to sustainability and productivity. With increasing challenges like climate change and water scarcity, farmers need to adopt innovative practices to conserve and use water effectively:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Drip Irrigation:</strong> This technique delivers water directly to the plant roots, reducing waste and ensuring maximum absorption.</li>
            <li><strong>Rainwater Harvesting:</strong> Collecting and storing rainwater can help reduce dependence on external water sources during dry seasons.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Irrigation Systems:</strong> AI-driven systems monitor weather conditions and soil moisture levels to deliver water only when needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Crop Selection:</strong> Planting drought-resistant and water-efficient crops can help optimize water usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Recycling:</strong> Recycling agricultural runoff through filtration systems can provide an additional water source for irrigation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">
            By implementing these strategies, farmers can reduce water wastage, lower costs, and contribute to a more sustainable future.
