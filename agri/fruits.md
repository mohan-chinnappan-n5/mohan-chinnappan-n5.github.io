# Slide 1
## What Are Fruit Trees?
- Fruit trees are perennial plants that produce edible fruits, such as apples, oranges, and cherries.
- Belong to various botanical families, including Rosaceae (e.g., apples, pears) and Rutaceae (e.g., citrus fruits).
- Grown for food, ornamental value, and ecological benefits like pollination support.

# Slide 2
## Types of Fruit Trees
- **Temperate Fruit Trees:** Lose leaves seasonally, e.g., apple, peach, cherry.
- **Subtropical Fruit Trees:** Evergreen, thrive in mild winters, e.g., orange, fig, pomegranate.
- **Tropical Fruit Trees:** Require warm, humid climates, e.g., mango, banana, avocado.

# Slide 3
## Temperate Fruit Trees
- **Apple (Malus domestica):** Crisp, versatile fruits; thrives in temperate climates.
- **Pear (Pyrus communis):** Sweet, juicy fruits; prefers temperate zones.
- **Cherry (Prunus avium):** Sweet or sour cherries; needs cold winters.

# Slide 4
## More Temperate Fruit Trees

- **Mandarin/Tangerine (Citrus reticulata):** Sweet, easy-to-peel citrus.
- **Fig (Ficus carica):** Sweet, soft fruits; adaptable to subtropical zones.
- **Pomegranate (Punica granatum):** Red, juicy seeds; thrives in arid, subtropical climates.

# Slide 7
## Tropical Fruit Trees
- **Mango (Mangifera indica):** Sweet, tropical fruits; requires warm, humid climates.
- **Banana (Musa spp.):** Soft, sweet fruits; grows in tropical regions.
- **Avocado (Persea americana):** Creamy, nutrient-rich fruits; thrives in tropical areas.

# Slide 8
## More Tropical Fruit Trees
- **Pineapple (Ananas comosus):** Sweet, spiky fruits; grows in tropical regions (not a tree, but included).
- **Papaya (Carica papaya):** Sweet, orange flesh; thrives in tropical areas.
- **Guava (Psidium guajava):** Sweet, aromatic fruits; grows in tropical climates.
- **Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus):** Large, sweet fruits; thrives in tropical regions.

# Slide 9
## Additional Tropical Fruit Trees
- **Lychee (Litchi chinensis):** Sweet, juicy fruits; requires tropical or subtropical climates.
- **Longan (Dimocarpus longan):** Sweet, smaller cousin of lychee; grows in tropical areas.
- **Rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum):** Hairy, sweet fruits; thrives in tropical climates.

# Slide 10
## Other Notable Fruit Trees
- **Olive (Olea europaea):** Oil-rich fruits; grows in Mediterranean climates.
- **Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera):** Sweet, sticky fruits; thrives in arid, tropical regions.
- **Kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa):** Fuzzy, green fruits; prefers temperate to subtropical climates.

# Slide 11
## More Notable Fruit Trees
- **Persimmon (Diospyros kaki):** Sweet, orange fruits; grows in temperate to subtropical areas.
- **Mulberry (Morus spp.):** Sweet, juicy fruits; adaptable to temperate and subtropical zones.

# Slide 12
## Growing Conditions
- **Climate:** Varies—temperate for apples, subtropical for oranges, tropical for mangoes.
- **Soil:** Well-drained, fertile soil with proper pH (e.g., 6.0–7.0 for most fruit trees).
- **Sunlight:** Full sun (6–8 hours daily) is essential for fruit production.
- **Watering:** Regular, deep watering, but avoid waterlogging.

# Slide 13
## Care and Maintenance
- **Pruning:** Remove dead or overcrowded branches to improve airflow and fruit quality.
- **Fertilization:** Use balanced fertilizers to support growth and fruiting.
- **Pest Control:** Manage pests like aphids, codling moths, and citrus scale with organic or chemical methods.
- **Harvesting:** Pick fruits at peak ripeness for best flavor and storage.

# Slide 14
## Challenges and Sustainability
- **Common Challenges:** Pests, diseases (e.g., fire blight, citrus greening), climate change, soil degradation.
- **Sustainable Practices:** Organic farming, polyculture, water conservation, recycling prunings.
