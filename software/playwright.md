# Slide 1
## What Is Playwright?
- Playwright is an open-source automation framework for testing web applications.
- Developed by Microsoft, it supports cross-browser testing for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (Safari).
- Used for end-to-end (E2E) testing, UI automation, and browser interaction.

# Slide 2
## Why Use Playwright?
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Tests run on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari with a single API.
- **Speed and Reliability:** Parallel execution, auto-waiting, and network interception for stable tests.
- **Modern Features:** Supports mobile emulation, headless browsing, and API testing.
- **Language Support:** Works with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, .NET, and Java.

# Slide 3
## Key Features of Playwright
- **Auto-Waiting:** Automatically waits for elements to be ready, reducing flaky tests.
- **Parallel Testing:** Run tests simultaneously across multiple browsers and devices.
- **Network Control:** Intercept, mock, or modify network requests and responses.
- **Screenshot and Video Recording:** Capture screenshots or record videos for debugging.

# Slide 4
## Supported Browsers and Environments
- **Chromium:** Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
- **Firefox:** Mozilla Firefox for desktop and mobile emulation.
- **WebKit:** Safari engine for macOS and iOS testing.
- **Headless and Headful:** Run tests in headless mode for speed or headful for visual debugging.

# Slide 5
## Playwright vs. Other Tools
- **Vs. Selenium:** Playwright is faster, supports multiple browsers natively, and has auto-waiting.
- **Vs. Puppeteer:** Playwright adds Firefox and WebKit support, with better multi-browser handling.
- **Vs. Cypress:** Playwright supports more browsers, offers mobile emulation, and is language-agnostic.
- **Vs. TestCafe:** Playwright has broader browser support and more advanced network controls.

# Slide 6
## Getting Started with Playwright
- **Installation:** `npm init playwright@latest` or use Python/Java/.NET equivalents.
- **Basic Script:** Use `page.goto()`, `page.click()`, and `expect()` for assertions.
- **Configuration:** Set up `playwright.config.ts` for browsers, timeouts, and reporting.
- **Example:** `const { test } = require('@playwright/test'); test('example', async ({ page }) => { await page.goto('https://example.com'); });`.

# Slide 7
## Writing Playwright Tests
- **Locators:** Use `page.locator()` for robust element selection (e.g., `page.locator('button#submit')`).
- **Assertions:** Use `expect()` for verifying states (e.g., `expect(page).toHaveURL('/')`).
- **Fixtures:** Leverage built-in fixtures like `page`, `browser`, and `context` for setup.
- **Data-Driven Testing:** Parameterize tests with test data or loops for coverage.

# Slide 8
## Advanced Playwright Features
- **Mobile Emulation:** Test on iPhone/iPad or Android devices with device descriptors.
- **API Testing:** Make HTTP requests and assert responses within tests.
- **Trace Viewer:** Record and debug test runs with detailed traces in the Playwright UI.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Check for WCAG compliance using `page.accessibility`.

# Slide 9
## Challenges and Best Practices
- **Flaky Tests:** Manage by using auto-waiting, retries, and stable locators.
- **Performance:** Optimize test speed with parallel execution and headless mode.
- **Maintenance:** Keep tests modular, use page objects, and update for browser changes.
- **Integration:** Combine with CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for automated testing.
