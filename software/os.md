# Slide 1
## What Are Operating Systems?
- An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services.
- Acts as an interface between users and hardware, enabling applications to run.
- Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

# Slide 2
## Types of Operating Systems
- **Single-User, Single-Task:** Designed for one user at a time, e.g., early DOS.
- **Single-User, Multi-Task:** Allows one user to run multiple tasks, e.g., Windows, macOS.
- **Multi-User, Multi-Task:** Supports multiple users and tasks simultaneously, e.g., Linux, Unix.
- **Real-Time OS:** Prioritizes tasks with strict timing, e.g., RTOS in embedded systems.

# Slide 3
## Popular Operating Systems
- **Windows:** Widely used on PCs for desktops, laptops, and gaming, known for user-friendliness.
- **macOS:** Apple’s OS for Macs, based on BSD Unix,  optimized for media, design, and development.
- **Linux:** Open-source, customizable, used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems. Most of the servers in the world are Linux based!
- **Android:** Mobile OS based on Linux, dominant in smartphones and tablets.

# Slide 4
## More Operating Systems
- **iOS:** Apple’s mobile OS for iPhones and iPads, known for security and integration.
- **Unix:** Robust, multi-user OS, precursor to Linux, used in servers and academia.
- **Chrome OS:** Lightweight, based on Linux, cloud-based OS for Chromebooks, focused on web apps.
- **FreeBSD:** BSD variant, based on Unix, used in servers, networking, and embedded systems.

# Slide 5
## Functions of Operating Systems
- **Process Management:** Handles task scheduling, multitasking, and resource allocation.
- **Memory Management:** Allocates and deallocates memory for processes.
- **File System Management:** Organizes, stores, and retrieves data on disks.
- **Device Management:** Controls hardware like printers, keyboards, and network devices.

# Slide 6
## Applications of Operating Systems
- **Desktops/Laptops:** Windows, macOS, Linux for productivity and entertainment.
- **Servers:** Linux, Unix for web hosting, databases, and cloud computing.
- **Mobile Devices:** Android, iOS for smartphones, tablets, and wearables.
- **Embedded Systems:** Real-time OS for IoT devices, cars, and industrial machines.

# Slide 7
## Components of an Operating System
- **Kernel:** Core component managing hardware and system resources.
- **Shell:** User interface (CLI or GUI) for interacting with the OS.
- **Drivers:** Software to communicate with hardware devices.
- **System Libraries:** Provide reusable functions for applications.

# Slide 8
## Challenges in Operating Systems
- **Security:** Vulnerabilities like malware, viruses, and unauthorized access.
- **Performance:** Balancing resource use for speed and efficiency.
- **Compatibility:** Supporting diverse hardware and software.
- **Scalability:** Handling growth in users, processes, or data for servers and clouds.

# Slide 9
## Trends in Operating Systems
- **Cloud Integration:** OSes like Chrome OS and Linux for cloud-native applications.
- **IoT and Embedded Systems:** Real-time OSes for smart devices and wearables.
- **Security Focus:** Enhanced encryption, sandboxing, and zero-trust architectures.
- **Open Source Growth:** Linux and BSD adoption in enterprise and development.
