# Slide 1
## What Is Website Performance?
- Website performance refers to how quickly and efficiently a website loads, responds, and operates.
- Critical for user experience, SEO rankings, conversion rates, and business success.
- Measured by metrics like load time, time to interactive, and page size.

# Slide 2
## Why Website Performance Matters
- **User Experience:** Fast sites retain users, slow sites increase bounce rates.
- **SEO Benefits:** Google ranks faster sites higher, improving visibility.
- **Conversion Rates:** Faster load times lead to more sales and engagement.
- **Mobile Users:** Critical for mobile-first indexing and low-bandwidth scenarios.

# Slide 3
## Key Performance Metrics
- **Page Load Time:** Time from request to full page render, ideally <3 seconds.
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** When the page is fully interactive, typically <5 seconds.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Time until first content appears, ideally <1.8 seconds.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Measures visual stability, should be <0.1. Unit: CLS is measured as a unitless score (a dimensionless number between 0 and 1).

# Slide 4
## Common Performance Issues
- **Large Image Files:** Unoptimized images slow down load times.
- **Uncompressed CSS/JS:** Bloated code increases page size and parsing time.
- **Excess HTTP Requests:** Too many resources (images, scripts) delay loading.
- **Server Response Time:** Slow servers or poor hosting impact performance.

# Slide 5
## Optimization Techniques
- **Image Optimization:** Compress, use modern formats (WebP), and lazy load.
- **Minification:** Reduce CSS, JavaScript, and HTML file sizes.
- **Caching:** Use browser and server caching to store static assets.
- **CDN Usage:** Distribute content via Content Delivery Networks for speed.

# Slide 6
## Tools for Measuring Performance
- **Google PageSpeed Insights:** Analyzes desktop/mobile performance and suggests improvements.
- **Lighthouse:** Integrated in Chrome DevTools, scores performance, SEO, and accessibility.
- **WebPageTest:** Simulates real-world conditions to measure load times and bottlenecks.
- **GTmetrix:** Provides detailed reports on speed, size, and optimization opportunities.

# Slide 7
## Frontend Optimization Strategies
- **Asynchronous Loading:** Load JavaScript and CSS asynchronously to prevent blocking.
- **Critical CSS:** Inline critical styles above the fold, deferring the rest.
- **Lazy Loading:** Load images and videos only when they enter the viewport.
- **Code Splitting:** Break JavaScript bundles into smaller chunks for faster initial load.

# Slide 8
## Backend Optimization Strategies
- **Server-Side Caching:** Use Redis or Memcached for dynamic content.
- **Database Optimization:** Index queries, use efficient schemas, and cache results.
- **Compression:** Enable GZIP or Brotli for faster data transfer.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across servers to handle high loads.

# Slide 9
## Trends in Website Performance
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):** Enhance performance with offline capability and fast loading.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Reduces latency with cloud functions for dynamic content.
- **Edge Computing:** Process data closer to users with CDNs and edge servers.
- **Core Web Vitals:** Googleâ€™s focus on LCP, FID, and CLS for ranking and UX.
