# Slide 1
## What Are Security Algorithms?
- Security algorithms are mathematical procedures or protocols used to protect data and communications.
- Ensure confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in digital systems.
- Examples include AES, RSA, SHA, and ECC, used in encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.

# Slide 2
## Types of Security Algorithms
- **Symmetric Encryption:** Uses a single key for encryption/decryption, e.g., AES, DES.
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Uses a public-private key pair, e.g., RSA, ECC.
- **Hashing Algorithms:** One-way functions for data integrity, e.g., SHA-256, MD5.
- **Digital Signatures:** Verify authenticity and integrity, e.g., RSA signatures, DSS.

# Slide 3
## Popular Security Algorithms
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** Symmetric encryption, widely used for securing data (128, 192, 256-bit keys).
- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):** Asymmetric encryption, used for key exchange and digital signatures.
- **SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm):** Hashing for data integrity, e.g., SHA-256, SHA-3.
- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography):** Asymmetric, efficient for mobile devices and IoT.

# Slide 4
## More Security Algorithms
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard):** Older symmetric encryption, now deprecated due to vulnerabilities.
- **3DES (Triple DES):** Enhanced version of DES, still used in legacy systems.
- **MD5:** Hashing algorithm, now considered insecure due to collision risks.
- **Blowfish:** Symmetric encryption, lightweight, used in various applications.

# Slide 5
## Functions of Security Algorithms
- **Encryption:** Protect data confidentiality (e.g., AES for data at rest).
- **Decryption:** Retrieve original data using keys (e.g., RSA private key).
- **Hashing:** Verify data integrity without revealing content (e.g., SHA-256).
- **Authentication:** Verify identity using digital signatures or keys (e.g., ECC).

# Slide 6
## Applications of Security Algorithms
- **Network Security:** SSL/TLS with AES and RSA for secure web browsing.
- **Data Protection:** AES for encrypting files, databases, and backups.
- **Digital Signatures:** RSA or ECC for authenticating emails, documents, and software.
- **Cryptocurrencies:** SHA-256 in Bitcoin for blockchain integrity and mining.

# Slide 7
## Key Concepts in Security Algorithms
- **Key Length:** Longer keys (e.g., 256-bit AES) increase security but slow performance.
- **Cipher Modes:** ECB, CBC, GCM for block ciphers like AES, affecting security and speed.
- **Salt and Pepper:** Enhance hashing (e.g., SHA-256) to prevent rainbow table attacks.
- **Quantum Resistance:** ECC and post-quantum algorithms like Lattice-based crypto for future security.

# Slide 8
## Challenges in Security Algorithms
- **Performance:** Balancing security (longer keys, complex algorithms) with speed.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Quantum computing threatens RSA and ECC; older algorithms (DES, MD5) are insecure.
- **Implementation Errors:** Bugs in code can expose vulnerabilities (e.g., Heartbleed).
- **Key Management:** Securely generating, storing, and distributing keys is critical.

# Slide 9
## Trends in Security Algorithms
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography:** Developing algorithms resistant to quantum attacks (e.g., Lattice, Multivariate).
- **Homomorphic Encryption:** Allows computations on encrypted data, e.g., for cloud security.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Enhance privacy, e.g., in blockchain and authentication.
- **AI-Driven Security:** Using machine learning to detect vulnerabilities and optimize algorithms.
