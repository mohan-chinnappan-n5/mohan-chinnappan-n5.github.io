        "Cryptocurrencies operate on a technology called blockchainâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers (nodes). Transactions are verified and added to the blockchain through consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).",
        "Once recorded, the data on the blockchain cannot be altered, ensuring transparency and security. Wallets (hot or cold) store cryptocurrencies, and users can trade them through exchanges."
