### 1. Introduction
This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the scope, deliverables, and terms for the implementation and optimization of Salesforce solutions for [Client Name]. The project aims to enhance the client’s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system by leveraging Salesforce capabilities, including custom FlexiPages, integrations, and reporting, to improve operational efficiency, user experience, and business outcomes.

### 2. Project Objectives
* Deploy a customized Salesforce instance tailored to [Client Name]’s business processes.
* Optimize FlexiPages for performance and usability across standard and complex use cases.
* Ensure accessibility compliance with industry standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1).
* Integrate Salesforce with [specify systems, e.g., ERP, marketing tools] for seamless data flow.
* Deliver training and documentation to empower [Client Name]’s team for ongoing management.

### 3. Scope of Work
#### 3.1 In-Scope
- Details here


#### 3.2 Out-of-Scope
* Development of custom applications outside Salesforce Lightning.
* Hardware procurement or network infrastructure upgrades.
* Ongoing post-deployment support beyond the agreed warranty period.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
This section details the functional requirements for the Salesforce implementation, with a focus on performance 

#### 4.1 Performance
The performance of Salesforce pages, measured as Experienced Page Time (EPT)—the time from user initiation to full interactivity—shall meet defined benchmarks based on page complexity. The EPT will vary depending on the number of components in FlexiPages, as outlined below:

##### 4.1.1 Standard Pages
* **Definition:** Pages with up to 15 components (e.g., fields, related lists, standard Lightning components).
* **EPT Target:** Maximum of 4 seconds under normal network conditions (RTT ≤ 50 ms, bandwidth ≥ 10 Mbps).
* **Measurement:** EPT will be validated using Salesforce Lightning Performance tools (e.g., Lightning Usage App) and browser-based metrics (e.g., Chrome DevTools).
* **Assumption:** Standard pages leverage pre-built components with minimal custom Apex or Visualforce.

##### 4.1.2 Larger Pages
* **Definition:** Pages exceeding 15 components, including complex custom Lightning Web Components (LWC), dynamic forms, or extensive third-party integrations.
* **EPT Target:** EPT values will vary based on the number of components and will be agreed upon on a case-by-case basis during the design phase.
* **Example Guidelines:**
    * 16–30 components: EPT target of 5–6 seconds.
    * 31–50 components: EPT target of 6–8 seconds.
    * 50+ components: EPT target to be determined via performance testing and stakeholder approval.
* **Performance Considerations:**
    * EPT increases linearly with component count due to rendering overhead and network round-trips.
    * Custom code (e.g., Apex triggers, SOQL queries) impacting server response time will be optimized to stay within Salesforce governor limits.
* **Agreement Process:** For each larger page, [Vendor Name] and [Client Name] will collaborate during the design review to establish an EPT baseline, documented in a Performance Agreement Addendum.

##### 4.1.3 Network Latency Impact
* **Definition:** Network latency, measured as RTT, is the time for data to travel between the client and Salesforce servers, influenced by geographic distance, network congestion, and infrastructure.
* **Impact on EPT:**
    * Higher RTT increases EPT by adding delays to each network-dependent operation (e.g., DNS lookup, TCP handshake, resource fetching).
    * **For standard pages (≤ 15 components):**
        * RTT ≤ 50 ms: EPT ≤ 4 seconds (baseline).
        * RTT ~100 ms: EPT may increase to ~4.5 seconds (additional 0.5 s from 5–10 RTTs).
        * RTT ~200 ms: EPT may increase to ~5–6 seconds (additional 1–2 s).
    * **For larger pages (> 15 components):** the impact scales with component count, as each additional request incurs an RTT penalty (e.g., 50 components at 200 ms RTT could add 2–3 seconds beyond rendering time).
* **Testing Conditions:** Performance benchmarks assume an RTT of ≤ 50 ms unless otherwise specified by [Client Name]. Testing with higher latency (e.g., 100 ms, 200 ms) will be conducted to simulate global user scenarios, with results documented.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Use Salesforce Edge Network or a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to reduce RTT where feasible.
    * Optimize resource loading (e.g., lazy loading, preloading) to minimize latency impact.
    * Document any network latency beyond 50 ms as a client-side factor affecting EPT, with adjustments to targets agreed upon during UAT.

##### 4.1.4 General Performance Standards
* **Server Response Time:** Initial server response (Time to First Byte, TTFB) ≤ 500 ms under normal conditions.
* **Parallel Loading:** Utilize HTTP/2 multiplexing to minimize latency for multiple resource requests.
* **Caching:** Implement client-side caching (e.g., Lightning Data Service) to reduce server calls for repeat interactions.

#### 4.2 Accessibility
The Salesforce implementation will comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA to ensure usability for all users, including those with disabilities.

##### 4.2.1 Key Requirements
* **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements (e.g., buttons, forms) must be fully operable via keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space).
* **Screen Reader Support:** ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks and labels will be implemented for custom components to ensure compatibility with screen readers (e.g., JAWS, NVDA).
* **Color Contrast:** Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for large text or graphical elements.
* **Focus Management:** Visible focus indicators for all interactive elements; focus order follows logical page flow.
* **Error Handling:** Form validation errors will be announced to assistive technologies with clear remediation instructions.

##### 4.2.2 Validation
* Accessibility testing will be conducted using tools like WAVE or axe, with manual verification by [Vendor Name]’s QA team.
* A compliance report will be delivered with each milestone, detailing WCAG adherence and any remediation actions.

#### 4.3 Other Functional Requirements
* **User Interface:** Consistent design using Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for a cohesive look and feel.
* **Data Integrity:** Validation rules and duplicate management to ensure data quality.
* **Scalability:** Support up to [specify user count, e.g., 500] concurrent users without degradation in EPT.
