Yes, IndexedDB in Chrome is based on LevelDB, which is a fast, key-value storage engine developed by Google.

How IndexedDB Uses LevelDB
	1.	Storage Backend
	â€¢	Chromeâ€™s IndexedDB implementation is built on top of LevelDB, a log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) database optimized for high-speed reads and writes.
	â€¢	Other browsers (e.g., Firefox) use different backends (e.g., SQLite).
	2.	Key-Value Storage Model
	â€¢	LevelDB stores data in sorted key-value pairs, which aligns well with IndexedDBâ€™s object stores and indexes.
	â€¢	IndexedDBâ€™s object stores map directly to LevelDB key-value pairs.
	3.	Performance Optimizations
	â€¢	Fast reads/writes: LevelDB is optimized for performance with batch writes, caching, and compression.
	â€¢	Automatic compaction: It periodically merges smaller data files to improve efficiency.
	4.	Persistence & Reliability
	â€¢	IndexedDB benefits from LevelDBâ€™s robustness, ensuring that data remains persistent across browser sessions.
	â€¢	It handles crashes and power failures efficiently.
