A DNS time of -1 in a HAR (HTTP Archive) file typically means that the timing information for the DNS resolution step of a network request is not available or could not be measured. In a HAR file, timing values are expressed in milliseconds, and a value of -1 is often used to indicate missing or undefined data.

Here are some common reasons for a DNS time of -1:

1. **Timing Data Not Captured:** In some cases, the network request might not include timing data for DNS resolution. This can happen if the browser or capturing tool didn't record this specific timing information.

2. **No DNS Resolution Needed:** If the DNS resolution was cached or the server's IP address was already known by the browser, there may be no actual DNS resolution step, and the timing information may be marked as -1.

3. **Inaccurate or Unavailable Data:** If there are issues with the HAR capture process or if the DNS resolution time couldn't be accurately measured, it might result in a value of -1.

In practice, a DNS time of -1 doesn't provide specific information about the DNS resolution process for that network request. It's essential to consider other timing metrics and contextual information in the HAR file to understand the performance characteristics of a web page and identify potential issues related to DNS resolution or other network-related activities.
