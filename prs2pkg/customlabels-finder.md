# GitHub PR Custom Labels Diff Checker
This script is designed to check if Salesforce Custom Labels have been modified in a list of GitHub pull requests (PRs). If changes are detected in the relevant CustomLabels files, it opens the PR diff in the web browser for review.

## Features
- Automatically detects the GitHub repository using gh repo view.
- Supports multiple PR numbers (comma-separated).
- Fetches all the files changed in the PR using GitHub's API and pagination, ensuring that all changes are covered 
- Checks if any of the files changed in the PR match the CustomLabels file path.
- Supports a dynamic file prefix for CustomLabels (e.g., src/sales/xyz).
- Prompts the user to confirm before opening the web browser to show the PR diff.


## Install
