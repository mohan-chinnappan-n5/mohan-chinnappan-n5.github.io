  - DKIM - Domain Keys Identified Mail
- Verification technique that allows the **receiver** to check if that email was **actually** sent and **authorized** by the owner of that domain (say: biz.com) which sent that email.
- Thus providing **assurance** to that email's authenticity.


## How it is done?
- Providing that email a **digital signature** called DKIM signature
- DKIM Signature is an encrypted string embedded in that email (invisibly)
- DKIM Signature can be verified  by the **recipient's** email **server** (running at say: zeroco2.org) by looking at the **public DNS** records of the domain which sent this email (biz.com)

- For example, Salesforce uses DKIM keys to **sign outbound emails that your organization** sends from the Salesforce platform.  When we create a DKIM key in Salesforce, Salesforce publishes the **TXT record containing your public key to DNS**. Salesforce  automatically rotate keys to reduce the risk of your keys becoming compromised by a third party.

- You will get this message:

- "Salesforce has published the TXT records for this DKIM key to DNS. Before **activating** this key, add the CNAME and Alternate CNAME records in the DNS for your domain."

- The CNAME or “canonical name” DNS record type is used to alias or redirect one DNS name to another DNS name.

## Need for SPF:
- The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) permits any computer to send email claiming to be from **any source address**. This is exploited by spammers and scammers who often use forged email addresses, making it more difficult to **trace a message back to its source**, and easy for spammers to hide their identity in order to avoid responsibility.



- SPF allows the owner of an Internet domain (say example.com) to specify which computers(IPs) are authorized to send mail with **envelope-from** addresses in that domain, using Domain Name System (DNS) records.

-  Receivers verifying the SPF information in TXT records may reject messages from unauthorized sources **before receiving the body of the message**.

- SPF provides a process to verify which **providers** can send emails on behalf of your domain (example.com).
- Use case
    - You like to send email from Salesforce 
    - You need to authorize Salesforce.com mail servers as allowed for the example.com domain.


```
example.com     TXT     "v=spf1 include:_spf.salesforce.com ~all"

```
-  The "~all" at the end specifies that, if the previous mechanisms did not match, the message should be rejected.


- You can see how Salesforce has this SPF record:
```
salesforce.com  text = "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:_spf.salesforce.com exists:%{i}._spf.corp.salesforce.com ~all"
```

<google-codelab-step label=' DMARC '>
<div id='s4-md' class='md' data-trim='false'>
  - Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) is an email authentication, policy, and reporting protocol. It’s built on top of Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) protocols.
- If neither of those authentication methods passes, the DMARC policy determines what to do with the message.
- DMARC is a **second layer of authentication** after DKIM and SPF. If an email doesn't pass DKIM and SPF authentication, DMARC policy tells the receiver **what to do with** the message. For example, it can reject some email messages and quarantine others.

- With DMARC, the receiver can report back to the sender when emails fail their DKIM and SPF checks, even if the messages aren’t rejected. 

- Example
```
Google has announced that they will implement a strict email authentication Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) policy in June 2016. This policy advises DMARC-compliant email servers to reject emails with **@gmail.com in the “from” address**, when such emails do not originate from Google’s mail servers.
