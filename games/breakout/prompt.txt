The initial prompt was simply

"How about a colored version of Breakout?"

First revision was:

"Make the player move automatically under computer control, and make the ball go 10% faster each time it bounces off the paddle"

Final rev was:

"Good, but the ball can get stuck in a vertical bounce.  How did the original game handle that?  Do the same!  And make the player aim for remaining bricks."
